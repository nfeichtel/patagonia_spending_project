# Data Structure & Initial Checks:


# Executive Summary:
Patagonia is an expensive place to travel. The highest costs for this specific trip are dining, accommodation, and transporation. On a per day basis, the most expensive cities to visit in patagonia are El Chalten, El Calafate, and Puerto Natales. Transactions were paid for with credit at a rate of nearly 3 times that of cash, with El Bolson being the only city where cash spent was great than credit used.
